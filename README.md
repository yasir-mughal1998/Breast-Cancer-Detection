# Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women globally, accounting for the majority of new cancer cases and cancer-related deaths according to global statistics, making it a major public health problem in the world. todayâ€™s society.
Over the past decades, machine learning techniques have been widely used in intelligent health systems, particularly for breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
I have implemented a Naive Bayes algorithm in Machine Learning using Python to detect Breast Cancer.
